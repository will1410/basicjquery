## What does jQuery have to do with Koha?

Koha has 4 system preferences that allow users to add JavaScript and jQuery to the OPAC, the staff client, the self-check-out system, and the self-check-in system.  Knowing some basic jQuery will allow you to make some changes to the appearance and operation of these components of Koha.

### Next question - what are those 4 system preferences?

## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a JavaScript library.  


### OK.  What's a JavaScript library?

In this context, a *library* is a set of pre-defined functions that can be accessed through a short-hand or abbreviated process.  For example, in JavaScript, the code needed to hide an element would look something like this:

~~~ JavaScript
document.getElementById("selector").style.display = "none";
~~~

while the same command in jQuery can be written this way:

~~~ JavaScript
$("selector").hide();
~~~

_("selector")_ replaces _document.getElementById("selector")_

_.hide()_ replaces _.style.display = "none";_
